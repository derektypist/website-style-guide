# Website Style Guide

The aim of the exercise is to provide a style guide of the colors, fonts and text styles.

## UX

As a user, in the colors panel, I expect the name of the color (e.g. Green Ash), hexadecimal value of the color (e.g. #A0DAA9) and the background color
corresponding to the name of that color.

As a user, in the fonts panel, I expect regular (normal), italic and bold styles.  Each letter in the alphabet to be at least once.  For example, `the quick brown
fox jumps over the lazy dog`.

As a user, in the fonts panel, I expect the name of the font to be used (e.g. Roboto).

As a user, in the text panel, I expect the name and brief description of the tag (e.g. `H1: Main Page Heading`).

As a user, in the text panel, I expect the font weight, font size and font family to be included.
